In order to consider a decreasing function I used 1 - cdf as a measure of distance from the solution.\n",

This normalization is necessary because otherwise the quantity of the cost and of the heuristic were not comparable (the priority key would practically depend only on the cost function -> Djikstra algorithm). Furthermore I decided to multiply this quantity by alpha in order to enlarge the range to (0, alpha), to guarantee a more complete exploration of the solution (otherwise there were some rare cases in which this algorithm didn't find the best solution). I set this alpha = 2, a bigger number would give more importance to the cost function and would lead to a more complete exploration of the solutions.\n"
