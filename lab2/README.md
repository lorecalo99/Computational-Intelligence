# This folder contains the solution of the second lab of computational intelligence (2023/2024)

The notebook lab2-nim contains all the code and the explanations of:
- nim game
- an expert system defined by me that is able to always achieve the victory if he starts the game and in general with 100% of win rate against the other already defined strategies
- a (1+lambda) evolution strategy that allows to learn when to use some strategies/moves during the game and that have got two different behaviors depending in which phase of the game it is (early/mid or end) thanks to two different sets of weights
