This is a folder for the lab9 of computational intelligence (2023/2024).
In the notebook you can find these principal sections:
- a first genetic algorithm with tournament selection, mutation, local-search mutation, crossover and elitism
- some improvemnents:
    - (1) self adaptive mutation rate and a counter to stop earlier in case of no improvements
    - (2) implementation of n-cut crossover
    - (3) mutation that flips all the bits in a certain range
    - (4) mutation that swaps 2 bits of an individual
